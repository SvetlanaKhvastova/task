        <li>
          <p>They use a principle from behavioral psychology called Operant Conditioning (don’t worry - it’s incredibly
            easy to learn this and we’ll show you how).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>And, they use a specific 6-step process that’s usually only known to people in the service dog training
            industry.</p>

      <p>Have you noticed how highly trained dogs maintain constant eye contact with their handlers?</p>
      <p>Most people think that this only happens because the dog has undergone years of specialized training and
        bonding with their handler… but that’s not true.</p>
      <p>The reason they can do this is that they have been trained on the <b>2 foundational commands that ALL service
          dogs
          are trained on: WATCH and TOUCH.</b></p>
      <p>Getting your dog to learn these 2 commands doesn’t take years of training - a week or so is all that it takes.
      </p>
      <p>These 2 commands are one of the main reasons that service dogs are so much calmer and more well-behaved than
        other dogs.</p>
      <p>And that’s why you’ll begin the masterclass by using your body language to teach your dog these 2 commands, so
        that they start focusing all their attention on you.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, most regular dog owners don’t know about these 2 foundational commands, which is precisely why
        most regular dogs never get trained properly - after all, if the foundations of a building are weak, the
        building can never be stable!</p>
