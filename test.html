        <li>
          <p>They use a principle from behavioral psychology called Operant Conditioning (donâ€™t worry - itâ€™s incredibly

        <li>

            industry.</p>

        <p>Letâ€™s face it - any Tom, Dick or Mary with some bacon in their hands can train a dog to sit in less than 3
          minutes. ðŸ™‚ No biggie.</p>
        <p>There are 1000s of free Youtube videos which will show you how to do just that.</p>
        <p>The real challenge though is to get your dog to:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_descr_var paw_wrap_var">
        <p>maintain eye contact with you and not blink an eyelid when someone elseâ€™s dog starts barking or lunging
          towards your dog during one of your walks, or</p>
        <p>sit calmly and remain sitting wherever youâ€™ve asked them to sit in a crowded farmerâ€™s market with the most
          yummy and smelly meals being prepared all around them, or</p>
        <p>remain calmly in their bed even though a bunch of screaming kids may be running around your house near their
          bed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_descr_var">
        <p>THAT level of calmness, obedience and impulse control - something that only service dogs typically exhibit -
          is what this masterclass is designed to help you achieve with your dog.</p>
        <p>And we will show you how to wean your dog away from treats so that they continue to remain calm and listen to
          you without any food bribes.</p>
