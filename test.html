                      with you. This work would otherwise be done by a bank manager or branch lender so you get access to the same rates as if you went to the lender directly.

                      If you have less than a 20% deposit (or are borrowing more than 80% of the properties value) then the bank will also need to get approval for your loan from
                      the mortgage insurers – who have the final say on the application.

                    <p>
                      Once your loan has been approved the banks often use solicitors to prepare the loan offer and contracts, as well a separate settlement agent to arranger
                      cheques and fund your loan.

                        A mortgage broker is a consultant that can help you with finding a home loan, or mortgage usually from their panel of lenders. Once the right home loan has
                        been selected, the mortgage broker will help you manage the home loan process, from initially signing the paperwork all the way until settlement.

                        A mortgage broker acts on your behalf to arrange a home loan through a bank or lender. Australian banks and lenders have different policies and loan
                        requirements, and it is a brokers job to find a loan from one of these parties that fit with your individual situation.

                        Mortgage Brokers can help find the right home loan for any situation, from purchasing your first home to buying an investment property all the way to
                        refinancing your mortgage to a better interest rate.

                        invested in your loan application - we don't get paid otherwise - so we will work very hard for it to get approved, as well as provide incredible service.

                      <p>
                        An Independent Mortgage Broker in Brisbane is a broker that is not subjected to outside authority. In other words, they should technically be charging a fee
                        for their services and not be paid commissions by the banks.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In Australia, brokers are not technically independent. Brokers use an aggregator, who provide access to all of the loans offered by the banks and lenders.
                        We are paid a commission from the banks for providing them with a home loan.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But there is still a difference between independently owned mortgage brokers, and those owned by banks. Mortgage brokers who are owned by the banks are
                        influenced to recommend the loans from the banks that own them.
                      </p>

                        <a href="/">Hunter Galloway</a> is an independently owned Mortgage Broker, not connected to any banks or lender. We use Connective Financial services as our

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We are not owned by a bank, and neither the aggregator or the banks have any influence on our decisions or loan recommendations. We only care about what is
                        best for you.

                      <p>
                        Using a mortgage broker gives you many more options than going directly through a bank. Individual banks can only offer you the small number of loans that
                        they have. We have access to over 40 banks in Australia, so we can find you the right lender and the right loan.
                      </p>
                      <p>The best mortgage brokers can help you through their intimate knowledge of credit policy, making the home loan process quick, easy and stress-free.</p>
                      <p>
                        We work with a wide range of borrowers, from <a href="/first-home-buyer-loans/">first home owners</a>,

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Through our intimate bank credit knowledge, we can find ‘secret’ policy exceptions to get approvals for applications that would normally get declined,
                        including no deposit <a href="/guarantor-home-loan/">guarantor home loans</a> and <a href="/unusual-employment-loan/">unusual employment loans.</a>

                        We also have very strong relationships with the credit teams and key staff at the banks meaning we are also in a good position to get the very best interest
                        rates for you. Often this means a cheaper variable or fixed interest rates, or rebates from the bank to cover the costs to

                        loan repayment will not change, even if interest rates go up.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The main benefit of a fixed rate mortgage is security. You know what your monthly repayments will be and you don't have to worry about interest rates rising
                        or falling.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A variable rate mortgage means that your mortgage repayments will change based on current interest rates. If the interest rates go up, then your repayments
                        will increase. If interest rates drop, so do your repayments.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The main benefit of a variable rate mortgage is flexibility. A variable rate home loan will allow you to make extra repayments without penalties and you
                        also have the option of extra facilities like offset accounts.

                        Managing risk is all about understanding your situation, and borrowing the right amount of money. Borrowing the absolute maximum amount of money possible
                        can be a problem if your financial or living circumstances change, so it's important to get the assistance of a mortgage broker to help make sure that
                        you're borrowing the right amount of money.

                        The length of a mortgage application depends on a lot of different factors, including the complexity of the application and the lender that you're using.
                        Simple applications with the most responsive lenders can be very quick. More complex applications or some of the slower lenders can take a bit more time.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are purchasing a property it's very common for us to have our finance approved within 14 days, or 2 weeks - sometimes less if you have tight finance
                        timeframes.

                      <p>
                        We will give you an idea of the expected time for your application when we submit it to the lenders, and keep you posted every step of the way. As a general
                        guide, though, most applications are settled within a month (and many are settled much quicker than that).

                    As members of the Financial Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA) and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) we must uphold the highest level of
                    excellence when helping clients with their finances. The members of each organisation must meet a minimum standard in experience, education and ongoing training
                    to maintain membership each year and as active members, we commit to upholding these standards, ensuring we maintain their high levels of compliance, integrity,
                    and professionalism with all of our mortgage clients.

                  <h3 class="inner_title">Valuation issues & credit scores</h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the most common issues we see is with bank valuations. Getting a low valuation can cause a lot of problems, and may ultimately stop your property journey
                    before it even begins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We can order free upfront valuations with many of our lenders, meaning we can find out what your bank thinks your property is worth - and resolve any issues
                    with shortfalls - way before applying with them. This protects you from wasting time on unsuccessful applications and avoids damaging your credit file.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Credit scores can also be a major issues. You might not realise this, but applying for home loans automatically initiates a credit enquiry. Multiple credit
                    enquiries over a short period - such as doing multiple home loan applications - can scare off some lenders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's why we do not apply with a bank until we have all parts of your loan application sorted and we know you have a very high chance of approval. It reduces
                    the risk of damaging your credit score and has the added benefit of getting your home loan approved quickly!
                  </p>

                <div class="box_list">
                  <h3 class="inner_title">Complex Credit Policy Pitfalls</h3>
                  <p>
                    Each lender and bank in Australia has a unique credit policy. For example, some lenders will accept your full income but others may not accept certain types of
                    income due to their policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quite often bank policy can be set in stone, and due to the complexity bank staff quite honestly don’t know it nor do many mortgage brokers in Brisbane. They
                    are not familiar with complex situations and how to correctly assess them. This can sometimes cause it to take quite a long time to process your application and
                    even in some instances mean your loan will get declined for no good reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With banks making their policies more and more complex it becomes more important to correctly package, and assess your application before it is even lodged with
                    the bank – showing the banks all of the strengths of your home loan application and making sure it fits all of their policies.
                  </p>
                  <p>At Hunter Galloway we have our own in-house credit team and we make sure your application is going to fit with the bank each time.</p>

                <h3 class="inner_title">What makes a good mortgage broker?</h3>
                <p>As with every profession, not all brokers are the same. There are good brokers, average brokers, and bad brokers.</p>
                <p>
                  A good broker will make the process of buying a home and getting a home loan stress-free and simple. A bad broker will do the opposite - and might even cause your
                  home loan application to be declined.
                </p>
                <p>So you want to work with a good broker. But what does a good broker do?</p>
                <p>
                  A good mortgage broker will put your best interests first. They will spend time with you to understand your needs and requirements. Once they understand your
                  goals and your financial situation, they will work out exactly how much you can afford to borrow across a number of different lenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there are any issues that could prevent you from being approved for a loan, or reduce your borrowing power, a good broker will work with you to resolve those
                  issues. If the issues can’t be resolved, they will find you a lender who can accommodate your unique situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A good broker will provide you with a list of different home loan options and explain how each loan option works, including the costs associated with each option.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They will guide you in your choices, but a good broker will not push you into choosing anything. They will work as a conduit between you and the banks to find you
                  the best loan possible, and manage the home loan process all the way from pre-approval to settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you’re not ready to buy a home right now, a good broker won’t leave you out in the cold - they will stay in touch and provide you the tools and educational
                  material you need to help you get in a position where you’re ready to buy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, a good broker will continue to look after your best interests even after the loan is settled. They will perform regular checks to make sure you’re still
                  getting the best available deal. If you’re not on the best rate, they will help you to refinance your home loan when the time is right.
                </p>

                    <p>
                      If you work with an inexperienced broker, there’s a much higher chance that they will make an error during your home loan process. They might tell you that
                      you don’t qualify for a loan because they don’t know all of the lending policies of the banks. Or they might find you a home loan that isn’t really the best
                      for you and your situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In a worst-case scenario, an inexperienced broker could cause your home loan application to be declined - either through a lack of knowledge, or a mistake in
                      the home loan application process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Experienced brokers know the lending policies of the banks inside and out. They know the loan application processes better, and they have the right
                      connections with the banks and lenders who can help push things along in the application process.
                    </p>
                    <p>Working with an experienced broker gives you the best chance of qualifying for a loan, and of finding a loan product that will give you the best rate.</p>
                    <p>
                      It’s even better if your broker owns property themselves - that way you know that they have been through the home loan application process as a customer as
                      well.
                    </p>

                      There’s a good chance that you found this page by searching “mortgage broker brisbane” on Google. Searching on Google is a great way to find a mortgage
                      broker, but that should just be the first step in the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>You should also check their reviews, testimonials, and online presence.</p>
                    <p>We recommend looking at reviews on the following sites:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <span
                          ><img class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" /><span
                            >Google Reviews</span
                          ></span
                        >
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span

                          ></span
                        >
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span
                          ><img class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" /><span
                            >Product Review</span
                          ></span

                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Spend a few minutes reading the reviews to make sure they are made by real people, as some brokers will pay for fake reviews to boost their online presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Take a look at their website as well. Do they provide a wide range of educational material? Are they actively producing content? Does it look like they are
                      staying on top of the latest developments in the home loan landscape?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, arrange a time to speak with your broker. Do they treat you as a unique individual, or do they have a “cookie-cutter” approach? Are they able to
                      explain the complexities of home loan finance in a clear, simple manner? Are they organised?
                    </p>

                  <h3 class="inner_title">When is the right time to speak to a mortgage broker?</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>
                      You can speak with a mortgage broker at any stage during your search for a home - you don’t have to wait until you’ve signed a contract. In fact, we recommend
                      reaching out to a broker early on in your home buying journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By speaking to a broker early on in the process, you can get some guidance about your borrowing capacity and your chances of getting approved for a loan. This
                      can help give you a quick “reality check”, and most importantly, it gives you time to resolve any financial issues that could prevent you from getting a home
                      when you’re ready to buy.

                  <h3 class="inner_title">What’s the benefit of using Hunter Galloway over any other Mortgage Broker in Brisbane?</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>
                      We’re not usually big on self-promotion here at Hunter Galloway. With over 500, 5-star Google reviews, we like to think that our reputation speaks for itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>That being said, there are some distinct advantages that we have over other brokers in Brisbane.</p>
                    <p>
                      To start with, we have a big focus on education. We have written over 200 blog posts, published over 200
                      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKw1JlNlcWR62EpSrXpfUWA" title="" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a>, created an
                      <a href="https://huntergalloway.thinkific.com/courses/home-hosed-7-steps-to-owning-your-first-home" title="" target="_blank">8-week online course</a>, and
                      even written a
                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Home-Hosed-Without-Sacrificing-Smashed/dp/1797515330" title="" target="_blank">book for first home buyers</a> — all focused
                      on teaching you everything you need to know about buying a home and getting a home loan. We even have a
                      <a href="https://hello.huntergalloway.com.au/finance-in-five" title="" target="_blank">weekly newsletter</a> to keep you up to date with the latest
                      developments in the finance world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another advantage we have is our size. With four brokers on staff supported by a team of two mortgage experts and six credit analysts, we are the perfect
                      size. Small enough that you get personalised service and care, but large enough that we can stay agile and efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, Hunter Galloway has spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on building the best possible home loan assessment and application process. Our
                      internal credit team thoroughly reviews your application <strong>before</strong> the bank ever sees it, meaning that we catch any major issues early on in the
                      process. Thanks to this process, Hunter Galloway has one of Australia’s lowest mortgage rejection rates at less than 3% (the industry average is 40%).
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="box_list">
                  <h3 class="inner_title">What is important other than the interest rate on a loan?</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>
                      Interest rates are always the first thing that comes to mind when anyone thinks about home loans. And they are important - thanks to the wonders of
                      compounding interest, a small reduction in your interest rate can translate into thousands of dollars saved over the lifetime of a 25- or 30-year loan.
                    </p>
                    <p>But interest rates are not everything.</p>
                    <p>
                      You also need to consider the features of the home loan. Is it fixed or variable? Does the loan have a redraw facility or an offset account? Are you able to
                      make extra repayments? What are the other fees and charges involved?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The home loan with the cheapest possible rate is not necessarily the best loan for your unique situation. And if you’re not careful, the cheapest available
                      home loan can actually cost you more than a slightly higher-rate home loan that’s better suited to your needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You need to take into account your goals for the property, your plans for the future, your lending preferences, and the loan features that you need. Then,
                      look for the cheapest interest rate home loan that fits in with the rest of your financial situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Luckily, you don’t need to do it alone. That’s what we’re here for. When you work with Hunter Galloway, we will do all of the leg work for you. We will spend
                      time with you to find out your goals and your finances, then we will go out to the home loan market and find the most suitable product.
