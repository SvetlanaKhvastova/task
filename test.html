        We will not disclose Personal Information collected from customers of our Website to third parties, except to companies with which we are actively affiliated, to
        contractors we use to support our business (such as technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions) whereby we will require such third parties to treat
        such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of our Website to which the
        information relates. We may hire third parties to review certain Personal Information to advise us on demographic and marketing related issues, but only after such third
        parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any Personal Information contained in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

        When your information is provided to third parties, these third parties may include providers of direct marketing services and applications. We or these third parties may

        offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. We will NEVER share your credit card
        information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us. By
        permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you. You also enable us to
        personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service. By submitting your email address on our Website, you agree to receive
        email from us and our third party advertisers. We, and our third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. You may cancel your
        participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the opt out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the email. We only send emails to people
        who have voluntarily provided us with such contact information, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails.
