              <p>
                However, savvy shoppers now have a more reliable, longer-lasting, and wallet-friendly solution in Magic Patches, which provide relief as long as they stay on the
                skin (for up to 7 days) and stay effective in water.

                Kids nowadays face more chemicals, artificial ingredients, and pollutants than ever. Most itch relief solutions will just add to the problem by exposing your child
                to even more toxins and chemicals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, unlike most other itch relief solutions, Magic Patch uses grid shape technology that mechanically adjusts the skin to help the lymphatic system drain
                the saliva injected by insects, relieving the itch response naturally and drug-free!
              </p>
              <p>
                Made with your kids in mind. Safe to use anywhere on the skin. No creams, no chemicals, just natural itch relief from mosquito and insect bites. A perfect option
                for sensitive skin.
