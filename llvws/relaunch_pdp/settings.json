It gave me plenty of time to relax and learn the basics of kayaking.

You can paddle this huge lake for hours taking in the gorgeous views and there is a beach area you can stop at if you want. The kayaks are very safe and almost impossible to turn over so you don‚Äôt need to worry about sinking or tipping over etc. It‚Äôs very hot in the summer so make sure you have sun cream on and a drink with you maybe.

It was a large group at 11:45 ( we noticed the next hour was about half or less as many people) but it wasn‚Äôt over crowded. It took 15 for instructions and putting on life vests then they released everyone to go in any direction you want. The 45 minutes was a perfect time, we were good and tired. If you are just spectating, there are free tables, but a better view is a little bistro but you will need to order something. There is also a little grocery store, snow cone stand and ice cream shop close. It was a beautiful place to visit."

If you're a guest at the Westin lake Resort it's so easy It's literally a 2-minute walk from your room to the private lagoon. \nEverything is super easy I scan the QR code at the front desk during check-in. After that everything is booked online you do the waiver online and it's pretty streamlined once you arrive. They have your name you just verify your ID and it's a quick maybe 30 second instruction on how not to sink or flip over. \nSuper fun and exciting and I can't wait to head back home and try it at a local kayaking place where I live.

So glad we did, there was plenty of parking in the garage and the area was fairly quiet. We went into the store signed a waiver and got a kayak without a booking. After paying for your rental you walk over to their docking area and they help you into a kayak. We kayaked around the lake for a little over two hours, even though it was a summer day, getting there early helped us beat the heat.

We went there to try fly boarding for the very first time. It was awesome. Once you got used to it we all had a great time. The person assisting us, Jessie, was a fantastic coach and made sure each of us had an enjoyable time. Highly recommended!!!!"

They do military discounts for those who served. \nI tried the fly board for the first time and Chris really made me into a pro in those 15 minutes of fame! Very patient and down to earth guy. Also the boats and paddle boards are fun, especially if they have the glow in the dark ones. 5 stars for me and me and my family will be going back definitely."

The online purchase process was super easy and there was a waiver I had to sign as well. I parked in the garage near the Lake Las Vegas shops and then walked over to the dock and was guided to the yacht where the check-in process was very simple and quick. They offered a glass of champagne and once inside, the appetizers were flowing very steadily out of the kitchen. I had multiple helpings because it was so yummy!!  Mostly, I stayed downstairs and enjoyed the cruise around the lake while taking in the view out of the many glass windows, in addition to being comfortable in the well air-conditioned cabin. Once it was time for fireworks, I proceeded upstairs to watch the show! It was great! Music was playing throughout the entire cruise and made it a blast!! Service was impeccable and the staff was so nice and friendly. They were also very attentive and were always cleaning and making sure the guests were well taken care of. I would highly recommend this yacht tour and am hoping they have others which are similar, coming up!!"

We decided to do the Sip & Sail on the yacht since some of us in the party wanted to drink.\nPros:\nWe got there early and the person who checked us in was friendly. No negative interactions with staff. \nOur reservation included a champagne toast - it was decent in taste. Other drinks included beer & margaritas (probably the favorite since it wasn't too sweet & you could taste tequila). \nMusic was good (although not really diverse). \nBathrooms were clean. \nWe got to go around the lake and see the awesome mansions in the area. \nCons:\nI'd been to the area before so I knew where to go to check in. I feel like if it were my first time it would have been more confusing since the map they provide in the confirmation email isn't very clear in their directions. \nFloor on the boat looked... a little worn. It looked as if it was lifting. Also, while leaning on the rail on the top deck, it came off. It easily went back on but it was surprising. \nOther notes:\nThere weren't too many people so folks were able to keep some distance. There was no signage or announcement about masks (not judging, just an observation).\nOverall:\nIt was something to do outside of the house on a Sunday. It was cool to see the mansions in the area. Probably won't do it again since I don't think it's really worth the price for a 2nd time. \nIf I could do it again, I would reserve the smaller boat rental (almost $100 cheaper). I would have preferred it to just be my party."

I booked three tickets for me and my girl friends about 2 weeks in advance and I accidentally booked them for the wrong day. The company was so helpful and got the tickets switched for me!!\nWe arrived early in case we had a hard time locating the office. We parked in the free parking and followed the signs which was super easy to find. It was about a 5 minute walk from the parking garage to the office that is located right on the lake. \nWe got a free mimosa as soon as we boarded the boat and we ordered serval more following. We of course took so many pictures and enjoy the cruise from inside the boat and on the decks. The bartenders, dj, and staff were all awesome! \nI definitely recommend checking this out!"
