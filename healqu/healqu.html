          <h3>Advanced Wound Care</h3>
          <p>
            We have harnessed the natural healing power of seaweed with his advanced wound care dressing. With high volume absorbtion, the dressing quickly absorbs exudates while
            forming a gel-like substrate covering over the wound. This substrate helps maintain a moist environment for ideal wound healing and keeps the dressing from adhering to
            the wound so it is painless to remove. Our silver particle additive creates an anti-bacterial shield that helps reduce the risk of infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>HEALQU® Silver Alginate Dressing</span> is comprised of natural fibers derived from seaweed. It is designed to be super-absorbent. The dressing absorbs exudates
            and forms a gel-like covering over the wound to maintain a moist environment for healing. The gel-like surface also prevents the dressing from adhering to the wound so
            it is painless to remove.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>HEALQU® Silver Alginate Dressing</span> is composed of calcium alginate and silver particles. The silver content is 50µg/100 cm2. The silver particles are in the
            form of encapsulated metallic silver, which is very stable and won’t oxidize even when exposed to light.

        <li>
          <p>
            This type of dressing is best used when the risk of infection is high. Wounds appropriately treated with the dressing are moderately to heavily exuding partial to full
            thickness wounds including (but not limited to):

              <h3>Notes:</h3>
              <p>
                Dressing change frequency will depend on patient condition and the amount of exudates. Initially it may be necessary to change the dressing every 24 hours. When
                exudate quantity subsides, dressing change frequency may be reduced.
              </p>
              <p>Observe the wound before removing dressing. If the wound appears dry, saturate the dressing with sterile saline water prior to removal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Precautions:</h3>
              <p>
                Systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered when wound infection is evident. HEALQUTM Silver Alginate Dressing may be used, under medical supervision, in
                conjunction with systemic antibiotics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dressing may adhere if used on dry or very lightly exuding wounds. If the dressing is not easily removed, moisten it with sterile saline solution prior to
                removal.
              </p>
              <p>The dressing performance may be impaired by excess use of petroleum-based ointments.</p>
              <p>For external use only.</p>
