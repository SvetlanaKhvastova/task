The advantage is that you are not stuck in front of a screen while you use it, so and you can get ready in the morning or eat breakfast with the glasses on. It is very practical :)",

            "text": "I use Luminettes since the beginning of October 2020 to deal with my Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). So far, I have no symptoms of SAD, despite the time changing (winter time) and the sun disappearing at 4:30 PM. It is a first. I am amazed.my energy level has increased and I feel free and joyous most of the time. I also sleep much better. I must add that I stopped caffeine, which helps as well. Luminettes are far, far better than the lamps. I wear them every morning without being obliged to stare at the lamp. My mood has really improved. They are very convenient and easy to use. I put them onto the top of my glasses. They recharge easily and they can be used without plugging them every day. Everyone who sees me wearing them (when I attend online meetings, when I go to the dentist, etc) are asking me if it works. People think it is pretty and they are very interested because they always have someone in their family with SAD, or they are afflicted by that disorder themselves. So really, no complaints, only good things to say about my Luminettes which are as precious now as my cell phone. Merci!",

I have been suffering from seasonal depression for several years, but thanks to Luminettes I have been feeling the effects of my mood disorders much less in autumn and winter. I use them from mid-fall until the end of March. I used to have a light therapy lamp, but it was quite restrictive to stay in front of it all the time. With my Luminettes I can go about my business without any problem. I am very satisfied!",

I spoke about it to the doctor who advised me to try the Luminette. I decided to buy it and use it every morning. So , I eat my breakfast with the Luminette on, without any discomfort, for 20 minutes. It allows me to move around and see what I'm doing, unlike the old devices that stayed on the table, and which, according to the studies carried out, were useless because the luminosity of the the leds did not come from higher than head level and thus did not reach the eye's sensors... Now, I feel fit and healthy during the day, and if during winter I feel tired after lunch, I do a I do a session again. This way, my body stops producing melatonin and my energy comes back, I feel better about myself and I'm in a better mood!",

I have been advised by health professionals (general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist and pharmacist) have advised me to use light therapy to improve my state in the fall and winter. I hesitated for a long time and then I discovered the Luminette. I use it in the morning, either while going about my business (breakfast, brushing my teeth brushing...) or when I'm reading. After the session, I have much more energy and motivation to face the day. It is very practical because it can be worn at the same time as my glasses or computer glasses. They are made of a rather rigid plastic, but they seem to be strong. They charge quite quickly. A charging indicator lets you know when it is finished. Once charged, they can be used about 10 times. There are 3 modes. The more powerful the light, the shorter the exposure time. What is very practical is that you don't have to watch the time because they turn off by themselves once the the session is over. The only small \"downside\" is that the most powerful mode can be glaring when the surrounding light is weak. I would recommend this product without hesitation, since it gives me a real moral boost during short days.",
