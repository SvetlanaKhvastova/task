  11: [`C`, `CelyanBasars`, `Best astrology experience I have a background in science, that's why I still have a healthy amount of skepticism. However, one of my friends advised that I check out Hint since I enjoy reading astrology as a tool that helps me to frame my thinking and the world in a viewpoint that is more neutral or positive. There are patterns, so the only thing I can think of is that there must be some kind of scientific basis that we haven't worked out yet. I don't have any belief in anything spiritual, but there are patterns. To sum it all up, I'm not someone who is easily swayed.`],
  12: [`T`, `Thxrnhill`, `Christi at Hint. THE BEST. she‚Äôs the only astrologer i‚Äôve matched up with that‚Äôs worked. my day to day horoscopes are very accurate and now finding her my questions are answered in a way that makes me feel satisfied. fav astro app fs.`],
