Flexible hamstrings allow you to more easily shift your weight forward onto your arms and head, and lift the weight of the legs with the core rather than swinging the legs up. Crista helps you establish this flexibility and strength so you can be ready for the final class, which takes you into the full pose. The first class in this series is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doyogawithme.com\/content\/headstand-pose-shoulders-and-core\">Headstand Pose: Shoulders and Core<\/a> and the third and final class is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doyogawithme.com\/content\/headstand-pose-full-pose-and-variations\">Headstand Pose: Full Pose and Variations<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

The three sections are: 1) Warming up to wheel pose, 2) Moving into wheel pose and 3) Deepening wheel pose, and you can stop with a short Savasana after 1 or 2 and take weeks or months to move onto part 3, when your body is ready.
