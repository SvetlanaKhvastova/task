          As explored in a previous case study, (<a class="underline-txt" href="/increasing-in-app-paid-subscription-plan/">HERE</a>), app users tend to have high expectations for <b class="ff-bold">free content</b> and high resistance towards <b class="ff-bold">in-app purchases</b>.

        <p>Originally, users had to progress through <b class="ff-bold">four stages</b> to subscribe to SwingU.

The stages were as followed:</p>

              <li>
                <p>Users would find multiple points on the <b class="ff-bold">upgrade popup redundant,</b> as the next two steps repeated the same information.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Users would struggle to gain <b class="ff-bold">clarity from the popup</b> – as it covered information on the Plus plan, but failed to inform users of the Pro plan, nor did it clearly highlight the differences between paid plans and free plans.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Users were unlikely to find the <b class="ff-bold">Upgrade Popup compelling</b> – the headline used CTA language (<b class="ff-bold">Upgrade to SwingU plus today</b>) which lacked any kind of intrigue or clear user-benefit.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Users were likely to be <b class="ff-bold">confused by the Popup’s messaging</b>. The CTA button at the bottom reads <b class="ff-bold">‘‘Get SwingU plus’’.</b> This makes it seem as thought users who click on the button will progress to payment. However, this isn’t meant to be the case. The Upgrade popup is only meant to progress users to the next page in the sequence.</p>

            <p>Our previous experiment informed us that users would be responsive to <b class="ff-bold">comparison tables that highlighted the features, strength, and weaknesses of each plan, and incentivize users to perceive the most expensive option as more desirable.</b> More detailed information on this can be found in the part <b class="ff-bold">1 experiment,</b> (<a class="underline-txt" href="/increasing-in-app-paid-subscription-plan/">HERE</a>).</p>
            <p>Also, from this experiment, we already knew which features would perform best when brought to a user's attention immediately, and which features could be revealed at a later date.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Finally, we knew that users responded positively to having the <b class="ff-bold">funnel compressed</b>, as merging the original stage 2 and 3 into one produced an uplift. Therefore, for this hypothesis, the information that we needed to consider was:</p>

              <li>
                <p>Testing how the <b class="ff-bold">conversion rate varies when users are urged to progress through the funnel by a 5 minute time limit between each funnel step</b>. However, the results we received for this were immediately unsatisfactory – it caused the vast majority of users to churn.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Second, we wanted to consider how <b class="ff-bold">having the comparison table appear even earlier in the funnel – as a replacement to the Upgrade Popup – could potentially produce a significant uplift. </b></p>

          <li>
            <p>Our decision to remove the old upgrade popup, and replace it with a new popup made from the <b class="ff-bold">comparison table page</b> is justified by the ‘Leaner Funnel Progression’ and ‘Cognitive Load Management’ sections of the previous hypothesis - found (<a class="underline-txt" href="/increasing-in-app-paid-subscription-plan/">HERE</a>).</p>

            <p>To improve visual clarity and ease of information consumption we decided to introduce a <b class="ff-bold">‘dropdown’ UI</b> that users could click to <b class="ff-bold">‘compare all features’</b>.

          <li>
            <p>To ensure that the collapsed UI stays as compelling as possible, we would take the <b class="ff-bold">most desirable paid features</b> that we identified earlier, and place them <b class="ff-bold">above the toggle fold</b>, so that they are <b class="ff-bold">immediately visible at all times.</b></p>
