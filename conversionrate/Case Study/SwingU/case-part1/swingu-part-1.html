      <div class="flow">
        <p>Consumer attitudes towards apps are often defined by high expectations for free content and high resistance towards in-app purchases or paid memberships. This presents a problem for monetization. A staple in modern thought leadership, Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow is an essential primer for anyone who wants to understand how effective use of comparison tables can counteract this issue. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow">
        <p>System 1 thinking (fast - emotionally volatile thinking) is what your users rely on whenever they take a negative knee-jerk reaction to your requests for monetization. However, when you correctly implement comparison tables into your funnel, you can push users into system 2 (slow – logical and analytical) thinking by drawing their attention to the limitations of your free membership, and contrasting them against the many features and benefits of your paid membership. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow">
        <p>From this, users can overcome their initial negative biases, and begin to see that opting for your paid memberships would be the most rational and constructive decision – thereby significantly increasing in-app conversion rates and ARPU.</p>

      <div class="flow">
        <p>The <b class="ff-bold">average app churn rate for a paid subscription over 30 days is more than 71%.</b> The average revenue per user for a paid app is roughly $0.70 cents.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow">
        <p>The above reveals a harsh truth – <b class="ff-bold">people dislike paying for apps.</b> For whatever reason, the perceived value of an app membership tends to be extremely low, especially when compared to other forms of consumerism.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow">

        <h4 class="heading-4">Based on the friction points and barriers to conversion that we discovered in our research phase, we developed the following hypothesis:</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="flow">
        <p>If we make the comparison table the most visible on-screen element, and improve the way that it organizes and communicates information, then we expect that users will find it easier to justify the purchase of a paid plan over the free plan. Additionally, condensing the Plan Promotion Page & Plan Selection Page will reduce the amount of actions that users need to take before committing. These two changes combined should reduce friction and confusion, thereby increasing conversion rate and ARPU significantly.</p>

          <li>
            <p>We expect to increase the percentage of users who choose the Pro Plan (most expensive plan) by having it as the pre-selected option on the page.</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <li><p>Users are likely to think that the default choice is the most popular choice, and while this is clearly a logical fallacy, playing into this bias will allow you to increase your percentage of higher-priced sales.</p></li>

            <p><b class="ff-bold">Gain-Loss Clarity -</b> Make the offer and the cost as clear as possible:</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Users will understand the offer better if we change the page’s headline from “Get every advantage on the course with SwingU Plus” to “Start Playing Better Golf Today”. This will communicate the value of the page and subscription upgrades more effectively, thereby incentivizing users to continue reading.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>We expect to justify the economics of each plan by listing prices in a weekly & yearly format, and showcasing how bigger purchases (yearly subscription, more expensive Pro subscription) will be more cost-efficient due to a built-in discount that we will highlight.</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <li><p>Having prices listed clearly can foster trust. If you obscure your prices then at best, your users will be confused, and at worst, they’ll be suspicious and suspect that you may be hiding something. This can lead to immediate churn. Instead, consider giving users the price in every possible format (week, month, yearly).</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b class="ff-bold">Cognitive Load Management -</b> Minimize the amount of information people need to process at once:</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>User buying emotions will increase if we make the comparison table visible from the first-screen and add a column for the free plan so that users can immediately see the ways that a paid membership will be superior to free membership.</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <li><p>Placing the ‘free’ option on the left and the ‘most expensive’ option on the right allows you to frame a clear progression from ‘least useful’ to ‘most useful’ (and by extension, most desirable.)</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users will find it easier to judge the paid plans as superior if we move highly desirable features to the top of the table, exclude confusing or irrelevant features, and improve the overall UI by giving the table better contrasting colors and more legible text sizes.</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <li><p>The primacy effect states that people are more likely to remember the first items in a list over anything else. Because of this, you always want to have the most impactful features listed first, and put anything less impactful in the middle.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users will engage with the CTA at a higher rate if we make it a large green button with copy that promotes the 7 day free trial for the Pro Plan. This offer will be reinforced with risk reversing microcopy above the CTA that notes “No commitment. Cancel Anytime”. (Users who select the Plus Plan will instead see the word ‘Continue’).</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <li><p>Framing your CTA as a free trial allows you to ‘sweeten the deal’ at the last minute, increasing the likelihood that users progress.</p></li>

            <p><b class="ff-bold">Content Hierarchy -</b> Placing most important information first allows it to benefit from the Primacy Effect:</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>More users will convert from the funnel if we move content such as videos and reviews to a lower point on the page. This is because this information is auxiliary - it’s not core to the experience of finding out which plan suits you best, but it can support your decision.</p></li>

          <p>We were pleased with the results generated by our first hypothesis. However, we felt confident that there was still <b class="ff-bold">room to improve on the initial experiment.</b> The concept of <b class="ff-bold">expanding information consumption through comparisons and accelerating funnel progression by removing steps</b> proved effective.</p>
          <p>So we became confident that reapplying a similar formula to other stages of the SwingU funnel, and <b class="ff-bold">augmenting them with UI changes that increased user agency</b>, could lead to even more significant improvement to the key metrics in this case.</p>
