        <p>Modern technology has conditioned customers to expect ease, speed, and convenience from their online shopping experience. <b class="ff-bold">The subscription replenishment model is perhaps the best way to fulfill this expectation.</b> Not only does the subscription model grant your business reliable and predictable revenue streams, it also deburdens your customer’s from having to remember to order, decide how much to order, or expend the mental energy and time required to log online and shop. Instead, your customers can now have the entire resupply process automated for them via Subscribe & Save. </p>
        <p><b class="ff-bold">By reducing the cognitive burden of resupply via Subscribe & Save, you not only make your store a much more attractive option for shoppers (Thereby increasing CVR),</b> but you also turn decision fatigue into an opportunity instead of a threat. Instead of customers deliberating or procrastinating over whether they should re-order, they’ll instead deliberate and procrastinate over whether they should pause or cancel their subscription – allowing you to monetize any consumer indecision. <b class="ff-bold">Finally, by having Subscribe & Save on your website (instead of a 3rd party seller), you grant yourself more flexibility and room for optimization.</b> For example, you can now use financial modeling to decide on the optimal $ discount amount for your particular store.</p>

        <p><b class="ff-bold">Of course, as with everything, there are downsides.

        <p><b class="ff-bold">Stores that sell low ticket consumer packaged goods should expect to see high repurchase rates.</b> But for SleepyPatch this was far from the case. Only a very small percentage of their customers returned for repurchase, and the client needed a clear solution.</p>
        <p><b class="ff-bold">On inspection, we realized that there was an immediate opportunity – automated delivery.</b> As things were, each time a customer needed more product they would need to make repeat visits to the sleepypatch online store and re-order manually.

          <li>By adding a subscription option to the page, <b class="ff-bold">highlighting the added 15% discount</b> on subscription orders, and having the new subscription price appear when selected; we would make it easier for users to compare the regular price to the subscribe & save price, thereby highlighting the latter option as more cost and value effective. From this, customers would have a clear incentive to click the subscribe & save option.</li>
          <li>By adding a tooltip that fully explains how the <b class="ff-bold">subscription service can be easily</b> altered, paused, or canceled, we would reverse the perceived risks of opting into the subscribe & save option by giving users a clear sense of control and agency over when and how the automated deliveries are scheduled.</li>
          <li>By adding a dropdown box that <b class="ff-bold">allows users to select the frequency and time-interval</b> between automated deliveries, we would allow users to immediately choose a delivery frequency that best suits their needs. <b class="ff-bold">Additionally, by offering</b> information that recommends the ideal repeat purchase interval according to family size and chosen pack-size, we would assist users in deciding what frequency will best meet their needs.</li>
